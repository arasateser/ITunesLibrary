# ITunesLibrary Project

My project is a clean-architecture-based .NET application designed to interact with and manage data from an iTunes-like database (Chinook database). It demonstrates a layered approach using Entity Framework for data access and C# for business logic, following software design principles.

## Project Overview

The project is structured to showcase best practices in building a maintainable, scalable, and testable application. It separates concerns into distinct layers:

* **Core:** Contains foundational elements like generic repository interfaces, base entities, and a custom result-handling mechanism
* **DataAccess:** Manages data persistence, specifically using Entity Framework Core for interaction with a SQL Server database. It implements a generic repository pattern to reduce boilerplate code for CRUD operations.
* **Business:** Implements the core business logic using managers that depend on abstractions from the DataAccess layer. It handles the orchestration of data operations and applies business rules.
* **Entities:** Defines the domain models that represent the database entities.
* **Web API:**

## Features

* **Layered Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns.
* **Generic Repository Pattern:** Reusable CRUD operations for various entities, reducing code duplication.
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Business logic depends on abstractions, enhancing flexibility and testability.
* **Result Pattern:** Consistent handling and communication of operation outcomes (success/failure, messages, data).
* **Entity Framework Core:** Utilizes EF Core for seamless object-relational mapping with a SQL Server database.
* **CRUD Operations:** Supports basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for Albums, Artists, and Tracks.
* **Specific Queries:** Includes examples of filtered queries.

## Technologies Used

* **C#:** The primary programming language.
* **.NET 8:** The framework for building the application.
* **Entity Framework:** ORM for database interactions.
* **SQL Server (LocalDB):** The database used for data storage.

## Areas for Future Improvement

* **Asynchronous Operations:** Convert I/O-bound operations to async/await for improved responsiveness and scalability.
* **Input Validation:** Add business rules and validation logic in the Business layer to ensure data integrity before persistence.
* **Logging:** Integrate a logging framework for better debugging and monitoring.
* **Unit and Integration Tests:** Implement a suite of automated tests to ensure the correctness and stability of the application's components.
* **Dependency Injection Container:** For larger applications, integrate an IoC container to manage the lifetime and injection of dependencies more effectively.
* **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Implement aspects like Caching, Transaction Management, and Performance logging as cross-cutting concerns.
